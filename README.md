Fire Alarm System using Arduino and GSM 🚨🔥
This project is a smart fire alarm system using an Arduino Uno, GSM module, and sensors to detect fire and smoke. The system triggers an alarm, displays real-time status on an LCD, and sends SMS alerts to predefined mobile numbers.

Features
✅ Fire & Smoke Detection – Uses flame and smoke sensors for early detection.
✅ Emergency Alerts via SMS – Notifies users instantly through a GSM module.
✅ Buzzer & LED Indicators – Provides audio-visual alerts for emergencies.
✅ LCD Display – Shows real-time smoke/fire levels and system status.
✅ Reliable & Cost-Effective – Uses low-cost components for a practical fire safety solution.

Hardware Components
Arduino Uno (Microcontroller)
GSM Module (For SMS alerts)
Flame Sensor (Detects fire)
MQ-2 Smoke Sensor (Detects smoke/gas)
16x2 I2C LCD Display (Shows alerts & sensor readings)
Buzzer & LEDs (For alarm & indication)
Flasher LEDs (Enhances visibility during alerts)
How It Works
Sensors detect fire/smoke.
Buzzer sounds and LED indicators turn ON.
LCD displays "FIRE HIGH" or "SMOKE HIGH".
GSM module sends an SMS alert to emergency contacts.
System resets when no fire/smoke is detected.
Code File
